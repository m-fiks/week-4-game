### Goal of the game:

*The game will generate a random number between 19 - 120.
*The player will click the buttons on the page, which have preset values, until their own score matches the random number.
*The number of wins and losses will be displayed on the page.
*After a player has won or lost a game, the game will reset the random number value and the values of the crystal buttons.
